# HebbianOptimization
This is a repository for the development of Hebbian models to optimize GPT 3's model. It is an active research project to integrate the brain's neuroplasticity into AI models. The purpose of the project is increase the efficiency of heavy energy and memory-consuming models such as GPT-3.
